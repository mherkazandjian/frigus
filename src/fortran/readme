Using the data by Wrathmall and Flower still causes negative population,
both imposing the normalization condition on the first row and on the last; in
the case of the data of Lique the condition to have positive level population
is by imposing the normalization condition on the first row
Such condition must be changed both in the file level_population.f03 and in
matrix_construction.f03

The file cooling_rate_summer.out is the one with the output by Mher for which
the comparison with my curves was ok.

In February, reharsing the codes, the comparison is not good anymore; the
cooling_rate.out is then the new output from Mher's codes.
