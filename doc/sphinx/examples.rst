Examples and Data files
=======================

The examples are located at

.. code-block:: bash

    frigus/src/python/examples

The examples should run from this directory as the data is expected to be
found at the relative path in

.. code-block:: bash

    frigus/src/python/examples/../../data

Assuming that Frigus is installed and can be imported, the simplest examples
that are the ones that compute the level populations at equilibrium for a two
level and three level system respectively:

.. code-block:: bash

    frigus/src/python/examples/cooling_function_two_level.py
    frigus/src/python/examples/cooling_function_three_level.py

In the following examples, the cooling function for H2 is computed

.. code-block:: bash

    frigus/src/python/examples/cooling_function_lique.py
